# Network Resilience Enhancements for Fatigue and Fleet Management Systems

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to improve network resilience and offline functionality in the fatigue and fleet management system. These changes address the issues of unstable network connectivity at Iduapriem Mine, which previously led to data syncing delays, incomplete event logging, and real-time monitoring failures.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Offline Data Caching with Auto-Sync

- **IndexedDB Storage**: All fatigue alerts are now cached locally using IndexedDB (via idb-keyval).
- **Automatic Synchronization**: When connectivity is restored, the system automatically syncs cached data with the server.
- **Priority-Based Sync Queue**: Critical alerts are prioritized in the sync queue to ensure the most important data is transmitted first.
- **Image Compression**: Large image data is automatically compressed to reduce bandwidth usage and improve sync reliability.

### 2. Enhanced Network Monitoring

- **Multi-Endpoint Health Checks**: The system now tests multiple endpoints to accurately assess network connectivity.
- **Connection Quality Assessment**: Network quality is classified as 'good', 'fair', or 'poor' based on latency and reliability.
- **WebSocket Connection Monitoring**: The system tracks WebSocket connections to provide more accurate network status information.
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Network events are logged with timestamps for troubleshooting and analysis.

### 3. Intelligent Retry Mechanism

- **Exponential Backoff**: Failed sync attempts use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server during connectivity issues.
- **Adaptive Retry Scheduling**: Retry intervals adjust based on connection quality and failure history.
- **Failure Tracking**: The system tracks sync failures to identify persistent issues and adjust retry strategies.
- **Maximum Retry Limits**: Different retry limits are set based on alert severity to ensure critical data is not abandoned.

### 4. Real-Time Alerts for Data Sync Issues

- **Browser Notifications**: Users receive browser notifications about sync status, failures, and successes.
- **Sync Status Tracking**: The application maintains detailed sync status information, including pending items, progress, and errors.
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Comprehensive logs help identify and troubleshoot sync issues.

### 5. Periodic Sync Checks

- **Background Sync Verification**: The system periodically checks for unsynced data and initiates sync if needed.
- **Time-Based Triggers**: Automatic sync is triggered if too much time has passed since the last successful sync.
- **Connection-Aware Scheduling**: Sync operations are only initiated when connection quality is sufficient.

## Technical Implementation

### Network Status Management

The network status is managed through a Svelte store that tracks:
- Online/offline status
- Connection quality (good/fair/poor)
- Latency measurements
- Sync status and progress
- Failure counts and history

### WebSocket Connection Management

- WebSocket connections are now centrally managed through a store
- Connection events (open, close, error) update the network status
- The active connection is made available to sync processes

### Sync Queue Processing

- Alerts are added to a sync queue when created
- The queue is processed when connectivity is available
- Failed items are tracked and retried with exponential backoff
- Sync history is maintained for troubleshooting

## Benefits

1. **Improved System Uptime**: The system remains functional even during network disruptions.
2. **Data Integrity**: No data is lost due to network issues; all events are captured and eventually synchronized.
3. **Real-Time Awareness**: Users are informed about sync status and network issues.
4. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Compressed images and intelligent retry mechanisms reduce bandwidth usage.
5. **Operational Continuity**: Fleet and fatigue monitoring continues uninterrupted despite connectivity challenges.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution for data modified both offline and online.
2. **Selective Sync**: Allow prioritization of specific data types based on operational importance.
3. **Network Coverage Mapping**: Track and visualize network quality across different mine areas.
4. **Predictive Connectivity**: Use historical data to predict connectivity issues and adjust system behavior proactively.
