# Fatigue Detection System Improvements

## Recent Updates

### 1. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

#### Recent Drivers First
- Drivers are now sorted by `lastSeen` timestamp (most recent first)
- Uses Svelte derived store for efficient sorting
- Real-time updates when new driver data arrives

#### Sync Indicators
- Added sync status indicator in the header showing pending sync count
- Individual driver sync indicators showing unsynced alerts per driver
- Manual sync button for immediate synchronization
- Visual indicators: green (synced), yellow (pending), red (error)

### 2. Improved Face Detection Algorithm

#### Enhanced Yawning Detection
- **Previous**: Simple expression-based detection prone to false positives
- **New**: Multi-factor detection using:
  - Mouth openness (surprised + fearful expressions)
  - Eye state (partially closed during yawn)
  - Neutral expression reduction
  - Increased cooldown period (5 seconds vs 3 seconds)
- **Result**: Significantly reduced false positives from laughing, talking, etc.

#### Human Presence Detection
- **New Feature**: Distinguishes between "no human present" and "human looking away"
- **Implementation**:
  - Confirms human presence after 1 second of consistent face detection
  - Only triggers "noFaceDetected" alerts if human was previously detected
  - Shows different messages: "NO HUMAN DETECTED" vs "HUMAN PRESENT - LOOKING AWAY"

#### Improved Detection Thresholds
- **Eye Closure**: Increased threshold from 0.15 to 0.18 (reduces false positives)
- **Drowsiness**: Increased duration from 1.5s to 2s (more accurate)
- **Head Down**: Increased duration from 1s to 1.5s (less sensitive)
- **Looking Away**: Increased duration from 2s to 2.5s (more stable)
- **Head Pose**: More conservative thresholds for all angles

#### Enhanced Debugging
- Added real-time display of:
  - Human presence status
  - Mouth openness values
  - Neutral expression values
  - All detection thresholds and current states

### 3. Alert Severity Adjustments

#### Reduced Yawning Severity
- **Workplace Fatigue**: High → Low
- **Driving Distraction**: High → Medium  
- **Attention Monitoring**: Low → Low
- **Safety Compliance**: Medium → Low

#### Added New Alert Types
- `lookingAway`: Detected when human is present but looking away
- `distraction`: Composite detection of non-neutral expression + head movement

### 4. Technical Improvements

#### Better Error Handling
- Improved camera access error handling
- Graceful fallbacks for model loading failures
- Enhanced WebSocket reconnection logic

#### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced detection frequency for better performance
- Optimized face detection parameters
- Better memory management for video streams

## Usage Instructions

### For Drivers
1. The system now requires confirmation of human presence before triggering certain alerts
2. Yawning detection is more accurate and less likely to trigger from normal activities
3. Look away detection only works when a human is confirmed present

### For Administrators
1. Recent drivers appear at the top of the list
2. Sync status is visible in the header and per driver
3. Manual sync button available for immediate synchronization
4. Better visual indicators for system status

## Testing Recommendations

### Yawning Detection
- Test with actual yawning vs laughing, talking, eating
- Verify reduced false positives
- Check cooldown periods work correctly

### Human Presence Detection
- Test with camera covered/uncovered
- Verify different messages for no human vs looking away
- Check timing thresholds are appropriate

### Admin Dashboard
- Test with multiple drivers
- Verify recent-first sorting
- Check sync indicators update correctly
- Test manual sync functionality

## Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
All thresholds can be adjusted in `src/lib/component/FatigueDetector.svelte`:

```javascript
const EYE_CLOSED_THRESHOLD = 0.18;
const DROWSINESS_THRESHOLD = 2000;
const HEAD_DOWN_THRESHOLD = 1500;
const LOOKING_AWAY_THRESHOLD = 2500;
const NO_FACE_THRESHOLD = 4000;
const YAWN_COOLDOWN = 5000;
const HEAD_DOWN_COOLDOWN = 6000;
```

### Human Presence Timing
```javascript
const humanPresenceThreshold = 1000; // 1 second to confirm human
const noHumanThreshold = 2000; // 2 seconds to confirm no human
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Model**: Consider training custom models for specific scenarios
2. **Calibration**: Add user-specific calibration for different face shapes/sizes
3. **Environmental Factors**: Account for lighting conditions and camera quality
4. **Multi-Face Detection**: Support for multiple people in frame
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed fatigue pattern analysis and reporting
